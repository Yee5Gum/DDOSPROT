<p>There aren't any fully effective ways to prevent a legitimate DDOS attack, unfortunately. There are however, ways to reduce the chance of being a victim. Anti-Virus Software, and firewalls are the most effective. As it says in the name, anti-virus/malware software are designed to search and destroy any virus that may be present within the system. Within the spam of traffic that comes from a DDOS attack, viruses may be present. As such, this type of software is effective in searching for anything hidden that may pose a threat to the system or network. It is a tool commonly adopted by large-scale coorporations to prevent cyber attacks such as DDOS. Firewalls act as a traffic filter. Depending on the configuration, they prevent certain types of traffic from entering or leaving the system at a specified rate or even at all. Illegitimate traffic from a DDOS will be discarded as soon as the firewall detects anything strange about it.</p>
