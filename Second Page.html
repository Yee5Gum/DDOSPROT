<p>DDOS stands for Distributed Denial of Service. It is a form of cyber attack that aims to make a server, website or any online service unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic from different sources. What happens during a DDOS attack is that multiple sources, possibly hundreds or thousands, will flood a target or even multiple targets at once with false packets and requests etc. . As the attack is coming from so many different sources, it is impossible to stop it by blocking the IP address. There are three types of DDOS attacks: Traffic, Bandwith, and Application.
The difference is, Traffic attacks spam packets, Bandwith attacks spam data, and Application attacks spam data messages. Each are capable of completely denying system services.</p>
