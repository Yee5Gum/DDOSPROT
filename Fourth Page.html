<p>Not all system disturbances are the work of a DDOS attack. However, certain signs do indicate of a possible attack, the most significant being the dramatic slowing down of the network. Functions such as the accessing of websites or even opening files will be slower than usual or even impossible. In some types of attacks, a possible symptom would be the increase of spam that is received in a system account.This is a sign that the system being used is being attacked directly instead of the entire network.</p>
